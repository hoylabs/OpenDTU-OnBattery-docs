# Available cases

!!!warning "Compatibility"

    Beware that these cases were originally designed for ESP32 boards with 4 MB
    of flash memory, which are not fully compatible with OpenDTU-OnBattery. When
    using such a case, make sure that an upgraded ESP32(-S3) with at least 8 MB
    of flash storage fits the case as well.
