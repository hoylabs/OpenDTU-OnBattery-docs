# Available layouts for printed circuit boards

!!!warning "Compatibility"

    Beware that these breakout PCBs were originally designed for ESP32 boards with 4 MB
    of flash memory, which are not compatible with OpenDTU-OnBattery. When
    using such a PCB, make sure that an upgraded ESP32(-S3) with at least 8 MB
    of flash storage fits the PCB as well.
