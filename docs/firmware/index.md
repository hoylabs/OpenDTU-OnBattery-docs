# Getting Started

## Download Firmware

The pre-compiled binary files can be found on the GitHub [Releases
Page](https://github.com/helgeerbe/OpenDTU-OnBattery/releases) (the right
column on the projects start page). Currently there are pre-compiled binaries
for ESP32 and ESP32-S3 MCUs.

!!! note "Note"
    All pre-compiled binaries require a mandatory [Device
    Profile](device_profiles.md). You have to upload one after flashing the
    firmware!

## Write Firmware to ESP32

!!! danger "Important"
    When flashing OpenDTU-OnBattery onto the ESP32 for the first time, you need to flash it over serial using the **factory** firmware binary file.
    You need to write the factory binary to the ESP32 flash chip at address `0x0`.

    The factory binary also contains a bootloader and partition scheme, which are needed to boot the ESP32.

Follow the [instructions to write ESP32 flash memory](flash_esp.md).
