# Community WebFlasher

Use the [Community WebFlasher](https://solar.metacontrol.eu/opendtu-onbattery-webflasher/)
to install OpenDTU-OnBattery on your ESP32 or ESP32-S3 board with a
user-defined release version of the pre-built firmware binaries (sourced from
the project's GitHub [Releases Page](https://github.com/helgeerbe/OpenDTU-OnBattery/releases)).

The WebFlasher is platform-independent, but requires the Chrome or Edge browser.
