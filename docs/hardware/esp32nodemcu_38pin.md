# ESP32 NodeMCU 38 pin

!!!note "Flash Memory"
    Get a version with at least 8 MB of flash memory to be able to use OTA updates.

To use this board please refer to the [Device Profile](../firmware/device_profiles.md) called `nodemcu_esp32.json` or `blinkyparts_esp32.json`. Both are nicely compatible with the dev board. Open the JSON file with a text editor and have a look at the specific pin numbers.
