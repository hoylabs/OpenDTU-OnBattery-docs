# Troubleshooting

* First: When there is no light on the solar panels, the inverter completely turns off and does not answer to OpenDTU-OnBattery! So if you assembled your OpenDTU-OnBattery in the evening, wait until tomorrow.
* When there is no data received from the inverter(s) - try to reduce the distance between the OpenDTU-OnBattery and the inverter (e.g. move it to the window towards the roof).
* Under Settings -> DTU Settings you can increase the transmit power "PA level". Default is "minimum".
* The NRF24L01+ needs relatively much current. With bad power supply (and especially bad cables!) a 10 µF capacitor soldered directly to the NRF24L01+ board connector brings more stability (pin 1+2 are the power supply). Note the polarity of the capacitor…
* You can try to use an USB power supply with 1 A or more instead of connecting the ESP32 to the computer.
* Try a different USB cable. Once again, a stable power source is important. Some USB cables are made of much plastic and very little copper inside.
* Double check that you have a radio module NRF24L01+ with a plus sign at the end. NRF24L01 module without the plus are not compatible with this project.
* There is no possibility of auto-discovering the inverters. Double check you have entered the serial numbers of the inverters correctly.
* OpenDTU-OnBattery needs access to a working NTP server to get the current date & time.
* If your problem persists, check the  [Issues on Github](https://github.com/helgeerbe/OpenDTU-OnBattery/issues){target=_blank}. Please inspect not only the open issues, also the closed issues contain useful information.
* Another source of information are the [Discussions](https://github.com/helgeerbe/OpenDTU-OnBattery/discussions/){target=_blank}
* When flashing with VSCode Plattform.IO fails and also with ESPRESSIF tool a demo bin file cannot be flashed to the ESP32 with error message "A fatal error occurred: MD5 of file does not match data in flash!" than un-wire/unconnect ESP32 from the NRF24L01+ board. Try to flash again and rewire afterwards.
* Make sure to connect one inverter only to one DTU (Original, Ahoy, OpenDTU, OpenDTU-OnBattery doesn't make a difference). If you query a inverter by multiple DTUs you will get strange peaks in your values.
